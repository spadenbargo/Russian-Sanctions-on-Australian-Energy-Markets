title = "The relationship between crude oil and natural gas prices: The role of the exchange rate",
abstract = "Several previous studies have found evidence that oil and natural gas prices in the United States are cointegrated. There is also evidence, however, that the relationship is unstable. One explanation is that technological changes alter the substitutability between natural gas and oil products.We reaffirm this finding, but also find evidence that the exchange rate influences the relative price of oil to natural gas in the United States. As in previous studies, we again find that short run departures from long run equilibrium are influenced by weather, product inventories, other seasonal factors and supply shocks such as severe tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the IAEE.

 abstract = {This paper investigates the trend in the monthly real price of oil between 1990 and 2008 with a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. Trend and volatility are estimated jointly with the maximum likelihood estimation. There is long persistence in the variance of oil price shocks, and a GARCH unit root (GUR) test can potentially yield a significant power gain relative to the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. After allowing for nonlinearity, the evidence supports a deterministic trend in the price of oil. The deterministic trend implies that influence of a price shock is transitory and policy efforts to restore a predictable price after a shock would be unwarranted in the long run.},
